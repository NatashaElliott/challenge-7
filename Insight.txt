Based on the analysis of ambulance response times across different UCLs (Urban Centres and Localities), we identified key trends in meeting the 85% and 90% response time targets for Code 1 incidents. A significant number of UCLs fall into the "Between 85%-90%" category, indicating that while they are relatively close to meeting the 90% target, there is still room for improvement. UCLs that meet the 90% target show strong performance, with efficient emergency response systems likely due to better infrastructure or resource allocation. Conversely, UCLs that consistently fail to meet the 85% target likely face challenges such as traffic congestion, limited ambulance availability, or greater distances to travel, particularly in rural or less populated areas.
